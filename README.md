## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Sanjana**, a BCA student and aspiring Data Analyst.

I enjoy exploring datasets and discovering hidden patterns in them.

What excites me most is understanding how those patterns help in making meaningful decisions through data analysis.

If you're also learning data analysis, we're probably on the same journey 🙂

I believe good analysis isn’t just about numbers — it's about understanding the story behind them and turning it into meaningful decisions.

⭐ Always learning, building, and improving with every project.
